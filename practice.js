/**
 * Notes of JavaSript DataTypes and Variables
 * DataTypes : 
 * undefine
 * null
 * Boolean - true/false
 * number
 * string
 * 
 * Variable :
 * var, const & let
 * 
 *
 */
// Practice making JavaScript Variables
let a = 0;
const b = 1;
a=5
// this will make an error b=20
console.log(a, b);
/**
 * Notes of Conditional and Switch statements
 *
 */
// Practice using conditional and swich statements

/**
 * Notes of JavaScript Loops
 *
 * IF Statement
 * if (){}...else if (){}... else {}
 *  
 * DO...WHILE Statement
 * do {} while ()
 * Do it once then check the statement
 * 
 * For Loop
 * for (i=1; i<10; i++) {}
 * 
 * Try 
 * help ignore the error
 * try {}
 *
 */
// Practice trying out loops

/**
 * Notes of JavaScript Functions
 *
 * function() must goes with () to show the input variables
 * 
 */
// Make Two JavaScript Functions below - One should include optional arguments and one should be an arrow function

/**
 * Some Questions to answer
 *
 * What is automatic type conversion?
 * JavaScript variables can be converted to a new variable and another data type by JavaScript itself
 * 
 * What is the importance of capitalisation in JavaScript?
 * JavaScript is case sensitive, the function will be different when using upper case and lower case, it may occur error if the letter is not in a correct way
 * 
 * In your own words and with examples describe what function scope is?
 * This means the variable is use only inside the function but not outside.
 * Create a function that contains closure, leave a comment describing what it does.
